"""
Exposes a simple HTTP API to search a users Gists via a regular expression.

Github provides the Gist service as a pastebin analog for sharing code and
other develpment artifacts.  See http://gist.github.com for details.  This
module implements a Flask server exposing two endpoints: a simple ping
endpoint to verify the server is up and responding and a search endpoint
providing a search across all public Gists for a given Github account.
